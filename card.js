/* Create a class Card. A card object will have 2 properties:

point - the point value of the card: a number between 1 and 13.
suit - the suit of the card: one of diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades.

A card will be created thus:
```js
> let myCard = new Card(5, 'diamonds')
```

And you can access the individual properties like:
```js
> myCard.point
5
> myCard.suit
'diamonds' */

class Card {
    constructor(point, suit) {
        this.point = point;
        this.suit = suit;
    };
}

let myCard = new Card (5, 'diamonds');
console.log(myCard)
