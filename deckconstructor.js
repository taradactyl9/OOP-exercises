/* ## Deck constructor
A deck is also represented as a collection of cards, but it would also be convenient for it to be able to shuffle itself, and be asked to draw a card. We would like to be able to do this with a Deck constructor:

```js
> var myDeck = new Deck()
> myDeck.draw()
Card {point: 6, suit: "clubs"}
> myDeck.draw()
Card {point: 1, suit: "spades"}
> myDeck.shuffle()
> myDeck.numCardsLeft()
50
```

Implement a Deck class that will allow for the above code to work. */

class Deck {
    constructor() {
        this.Deck
    }
}

var myDeck = new Deck()
myDeck.draw();
Card {point: 6, suit: "clubs"}
myDeck.draw();
Card {point: 1, suit: "spades"}
myDeck.shuffle();
myDeck.numCardsLeft()
50
myDeck.draw();
myDeck.numCardsLeft();
